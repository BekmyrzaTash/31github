//IntelilJ and Git continues to surprise me and complicate all the stuff. 
//The problem was that the program didnt want to run the code, rxplaining it with an error: java: class IfElse is public, should be declared in a file named IfElse.java
//But the names of both,project and files were correct
//I hope Ill be able to find the exact bug
